This assignment was about navigating how to change a messy set of data, into a cleaned up more readable version. The project was 4 steps. Loading in the raw data (the messy data), cleaning the column names, taking out zeroes and blanks, and getting rid of parts that had negative values. 

The most difficult part of this was trying to figure out all the bugs. As I tried running the code, I had to deal with indentation errors, type errors, and other kinds as well. When I realized that the code was interpreting the price column as text instead of numbers, that had to be the biggest break through for me. The first place where I used copilot was the cleaning column names part. The suggestion it gave was the normal .lower().replace('_') chain. To modify it i added the .str.strip() part to get rid of invisible spaces in the columns. The handle missing values function had the biggest change made to the suggestion, where I had to add the pd.to_numeric line which forced data to be numeric data in the DataFrame columns. Copilot gave me the initial fillna(0) which was helpful, but not the full thing I needed. 

My biggest struggle was figuring out what to change to fix errors when my code looked fine, at least to me. The copilot is helpful, but it really showed me how you cant rely on just that because it doesnt take into account things like numeric data being saved as text in the CSV. Fixing bugs was probably the biggest learning curve.
